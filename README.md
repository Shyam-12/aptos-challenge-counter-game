# aptos-challenge-counter-game

The Project is Incomplete!

The UI of the game has these parts: 

1. A “Connect Wallet” button so users can link their wallets, using the [Wallet Adapter](https://aptos.dev/tutorials/build-e2e-dapp/add-wallet-support)
2. A big circle button that a user can click
3. A number, displayed prominently, which will show how many times the button has been clicked globally

I tried my best to learn the move language as much as possible and write the smart contract and follow the dapp article in the aptos website to build the UI. But I could not fetch the data from the blockchain.
